                </div>
                <p class="lead">Product Requirement</p>
                We normally invest in products that are either in the ideation phase or have already built a Minimum Viable Product. This means the applicant has already done some research into the idea, and has established a valid demand. We do not require the product to have any sort of operating data, but applicants must be able to clearly state what the product is, the total addressable market and the user profile.
                <br><br>
                <p class="lead">Eligibility</p>
                At least one current student or recent graduate (within last 6 months) must be present in the founding team. We will prioritize applications from juniors, seniors and masters students but will place equal considerations on freshmen and sophomores. For freshmen and sophomores, we recommend looking into <a href="https://thielfellowship.org">The Thiel Fellowship</a> as it may be a better fit for your endeavor.
                <br><br>
                <p class="lead">Application Materials</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A presentation. The presentation should be concise and provide a clear big picture - what you are pitching, why it works, how it works, and how it fits the grand scheme of things.</li>
                    <li>A prospectus. The prospectus should be detailed. In addition to all contents in the presentation, please include any research and survey data you may have that supports your product having a validated demand.</li>
                    <li>Current product (if applicable). If you have already started working on your product, please provide us with your current version of the product. If there is a Minimum Viable Product, please submit a video demo or live demo.</li>
                </ol>
                If you have any supporting materials that you think may help our deliberation, please send an email to <a href="mailto:bp@initium.fund"> bp@initium.fund</a> with the subject [your name] Application Supporting Materials after you submit the application form.
                <br><br>
                <p class="lead">Application Timeline</p>
                After you sucessfully submit the application, we will follow the following timeline and procedures in evaluating your application:
                <ul>
                    <li>Within 3 business days: an Investment Partner and a Campus Partner will compete the initial screening and get back to you with initial feedbacks.</li>
                    <li>Within 5 business days: we will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with you. The application will complete our internal process. Our investment team will begin Due Dilligence.</li>
                    <li>Between 5-10 business days: Members of our investment team will meet with you either in-person or online, and continue our Due Dilligence process.</li>
                    <li>Within 12 business days: Our Investment Committee will meet with you either in-erson or online. The Investment Committee will complete the vetting process and produce a voting result.</li>
                    <li>Within 15 business days: You will sign the SAFE, and we will write you the check.</li>
                </ul>
                When we face a backlog, we will amend the aforementioned timeline and procedures as we see fit and communicate with applicants promptly.

SAFE is an open-sourced agreement published by the famed Y Combinator. If you decide to take the money, we will issue a $2,000 to $5,000 check.

                                <div class="ac-content" style="display: none;">SAFE is the most founder-friendly investment agreement. It is a convertible note.

                                <div class="ac-content" style="display: none;">A convertible note is a financial instrument that converts to equity once certain conditions are met. Although the convertible note we issue will most likely not become your personal debts, there are exceptional situations where you would be liable to the note (such as gross negligence). We want you to be serious about this investment, as we are investing in you in good faith.</div>

                                <div class="ac-content" style="display: none;">We will work together to come up with a reasonable schedule for SAFE conversion. Normally, we will convert to equity when you undergo your next round of fundraising, with a discount rate of 20%. </div>
